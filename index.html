		<h1>AtoZ CSS is moving to <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com">Sitepoint</a></h1>
		<p>AtoZ CSS has been acquired by Sitepoint and in due course, all the videos and blog posts previously available at atozcss.com will be migrating across to their new home on www.sitepoint.com.</p>
		<p>The AtoZ videos and blog posts will remain free after the transfer but will no longer be available at atozcss.com. This will happen over the coming weeks and months and will include the completion of the Sass series which is currently on pause.</p>
		<p>Thanks so much for your support of AtoZ CSS. I wish you all the best with your future CSS learnings.</p>
		<p>If there's ever anything I can do to help you or any topics you'd like to see covered on Sitepoint, do <a href="mailto:guy.routledge@sitepoint.com">let me know</a>. We'll continue to produce high quality video content for you at sitepoint.com and we always welcome suggestions from designers and developers just like you to help you solve real problems and produce your best possible work.</p>
