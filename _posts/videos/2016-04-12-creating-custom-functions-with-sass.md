  Functions are a core concept in many programming languages but

  CSS.  However, Sass brings the power of programming to the table and

  In this episode you'll learn what functions can do and why they're

  examples of functions in the real world

summary: |
  Sass functions are used to perform repeatable tasks. 
  They are commonly combined with maths to manipulate values
  and convert an input value into another value called the `return`.

  Sass functions take the following form:

  	@function function-name( $parameters ) {
  		// do stuff with input $parameters
  		@return $output-value;
  	}

  Examples in this episode include converting pixel values to `em` or
  `rem`, stripping units from a length and combining functions together
  to create more complex behaviour.

Functions are a core concept in many programming languages but creating
our own custom functions isn't something we can use in normal CSS.

However, Sass brings the power of programming to the table and *does*
allow us to create custom functions for performing common tasks.

In this episode you'll learn:

* What functions can do and why they're useful
* How to create and use your own custom functions in Sass
* Examples of functions in the real world



## What and Why?

Functions wrap up a named sequence of instructions that generates
a value.  They often accept input parameters (called arguments) and
return back an output value.

Functions provide the blueprint for a repeatable process that takes one
value (or multiple values), performs some kind of calculation and then
sends back a new value. They are ideal for performing mathematical
operations or converting one type of value into another type of value.

{% highlight bash %}
@function function-name( $parameters ) {
	// do stuff with input $parameters
	@return $output-value;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Using functions hands over the responsibility of doing complex
calculations to a machine rather than leaving that work and mental
overhead to ourselves. This can help us work faster and reduces the risk
of human error.

If you're not familiar with programming, the concept of functions can be
a little abstract to get your head around to begin with so let's look at
an example.



## Creating and Using Functions

Let's take the example of converting a pixel value into a rem value.
These are both CSS lengths that can be set for a number of CSS
properties like `font-size` or `padding`.

When working on a responsive project, it's often preferable to use
relative units like `rem` instead of `px` so we can build a flexible
system of proportions rather than sizing every last component to
absolute widths, heights and spacing values.

While using `rem` values produces more flexible elements, it's often
easier to visualize pixel values. So we could create a Sass function
that converts pixels into rems, giving us the best of both worlds and
removing the need for constantly reaching for a calculator; I hate CSS
maths so if I can get a machine to do this for me, all the better!

Before we look at the Sass syntax for creating and using a function,
let's look at the calculation that converts pixels to rems.

The base font size is `16px` which is the equivalent to `1rem`. If we
wanted to express `32px` in rems we'd divide 32 by 16 and get the
result: `2rem`

{% highlight scss %}
32px / 16px = 2
{% endhighlight %}

If we wanted to express `8px` in rems we'd divide 8 by 16 which gives
the result 0.5.

{% highlight scss %}
8px / 16px = 0.5
{% endhighlight %}

So the calculation to convert a pixel value to a rem value is to divide
the pixel value by the base font-size and then multiply this by 1rem. We
can create a Sass function to automate this process for us as follows:

{% highlight scss %}
$base-font-size: 16px;

@function px-to-rem( $value ) {
	@return ( $value / $base-font-size ) * 1rem;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Our function accepts an input which we've called `$value` and sends back
a `return` value in rems.

To use this function, we call it as follows:

{% highlight scss %}
.element {
	font-size: px-to-rem( 20px );
}
{% endhighlight %}

This will convert `20px` to `1.25rem` and compile to 

{% highlight scss %}
.element {
	font-size: 1.25rem;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Instead of reaching for a calculator or doing a quick sum in our head,
we can leverage the power of Sass to do that for us so we can focus on
solving more interesting problems.



## Real World Functions

The previous example demonstrated the essence of functions; taking one
value and turning it into another. But in a real-world project, we may
want or need to make our functions more flexible by accepting different
types of input.

In a future episode we'll look at adding flow control and conditional
statements to functions as well as debugging functions and warning the
user of incorrect use, but for now, let's add a couple of extra features
to this pixel to rem converter.

Let's make our function more flexible and allow it to accept either
a pixel length or a number (that's assumed to be a number of pixels) and
convert it into rems.

To do that, we'll first make another function which turns any length
value into a number without any units. Once we've done that, we can
combine the two together.

To create a function that strips units from a length value, we need to
divide the length by a single unit of itself.

So to convert 20px into the number 20, we need to divide 20px by 1px.
To convert 80em into the number 80, we need to divide 80em by 1em.

The following function does exactly this:

{% highlight scss %}
@function strip-units( $length ) {
	@return $length / ( ( $length * 0 ) + 1 );
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can update our `px-to-rem` function to strip any units from the
input values by calling the `strip-units` function.

{% highlight scss %}
@function px-to-rem( $value ) {
	$value: strip-units( $value );
	$base-font-size: strip-units( $base-font-size );

	@return ( $value / $base-font-size ) * 1rem;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now we can call the function with a `px` length or a number as follows:

{% highlight scss %}
.element {
	font-size: px-to-rem( 20px );
	padding: px-to-rem( 15 );
}
{% endhighlight %}

Which will output

{% highlight scss %}
.element {
	font-size: 1.25rem;
	padding: 0.9375rem;
}
{% endhighlight %}

So not only is our function flexible but it's really useful; instead of
seeing values like `0.9375rem` in the stylesheet and trying to get
a sense of what that means, we can see a number like `15` and can almost
immediately get a sense of the kind of length we're talking about.

In the next episode we'll be tackling G for "Grunt & Gulp" which are 
command line tools that you can use to automate the task of compiling
your Sass (and many more tasks too).
