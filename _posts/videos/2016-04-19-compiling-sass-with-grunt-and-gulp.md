summary: |
  Grunt and Gulp are both JavaScript powered build tools. They can be
  used to compile Sass, start local servers, run linters, automatically
  add vendor prefixes, inline CSS and much, much more!

  While both tools do similar things, they work in very different ways
  behind the scenes.

  Grunt uses a declarative approach to configuring tasks (for things
  like compiling CSS). A Gruntfile.js contains a large configuration
  object that specifies the options for each task - things like where to
  find the imput Sass files, where to output the compiled CSS and what
  output style should be used.

  Gulp uses "streams" and it's configuration style may look familiar if
  you work with jQuery code a lot.

  I've used both but now favour Gulp for compiling my Sass predominantly
  because it uses Node Sass behind the scenes which runs incredibly
  fast, cutting down development time significantly.

In my ebook, Up and Running with Sass there are two step-by-step
exercises for installing and compiling Sass. One uses the `sass` command
in the terminal and one uses a free app called Koala for setting up a 
Sass project and compiling styles through a more graphical interface.

In this video we'll be diving into two more command line tools that can help
you compile Sass. They both do a *lot* more than just compile Sass so
they're definitely worth looking in to. But for the purposes of keeping
this video short and to the point, we'll just focus on the Sass side of
things.

So, in this video you'll learn

* What Grunt and Gulp are why they're useful
* How to set up Grunt to compile your Sass
* How to set up Gulp to compile your Sass
* Some next steps to supercharge your workflow



## What are Grunt and Gulp

Grunt and Gulp are two popular tools for helping automate your
development workflow. They're command line tools that are written in
JavaScript and to use them you'll need to install NodeJS and the Node
Package Manager. 

If you want to follow along with this video, head over to the [Node JS
website](https://nodejs.org/en/) for installation instructions.

Grunt and Gulp can both perform a number of tasks for jobs like
minifying or compressing your code, concatenating multiple files
together, checking code for errors, compressing images or compiling
Sass. They have a slightly different approach to these tasks and you'd
only use on or other of them on an individual project.

Tools like this may sound overly complex, a bit abstract or even a bit
scary if you're new to web development. You're not alone. I felt the
same way in the past but the only way to get better at your craft is to
break out of your comfort zone.

For a great introduction to tools like Grunt, Chris Coiyer wrote an
excellent article titled [Grunt for people who think things like Grunt
are weird and hard](https://24ways.org/2013/grunt-is-not-weird-and-hard/) 
a couple of years ago for 24 Ways.

Let's dive in to a practical step by step guide to using Grunt or Gulp.
You can then decide which one you prefer or chose to use neither and
keep with your existing process.



## Compiling Sass with Grunt

I've got a simple project here with an `scss` folder containing
a `main.scss` file and a `css` folder where the styles will be compiled.

With Node and `npm` installed, next we need to install Grunt. This is
done from the command line with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install grunt-cli -g
{% endhighlight %}

The `-g` stands for "global" and this will install the Grunt command
line interface so it can be used on any of your projects. This is
something that only needs to be done once; if you already have Grunt
installed, you can skip this step.

Once installed, we need to create a file called `package.json` which
contains information about a series of tools (called node modules) that
Grunt needs to perform all its tasks - like watching files for changes
and compiling Sass.

On the command line, ensure you're in the project folder and run

{% highlight bash %}
npm init
{% endhighlight %}

Answer the questions if you're setting up a real project or just hit
enter to use the defaults.

Now we can install a local version of Grunt and two additional packages:
one for watching files for changes and one for compiling Sass. Run the
following command to install these packages and save the details to the
`package.json`

{% highlight bash %}
npm install --save-dev grunt grunt-contrib-watch grunt-contrib-sass
{% endhighlight %}

If you look in your package.json file, there should be a list of the
3 packages that were just installed:

{% highlight json %}
"devDependencies": {
	"grunt": "^0.4.5",
	"grunt-contrib-sass": "^0.9.2",
	"grunt-contrib-watch": "^0.6.1"
}
{% endhighlight %}

With everything installed, we now need to create a configuration file to
tell Grunt what we want it to do.

Create a new file named `gruntfile.js` in the root of the project and
add the following code (just head to
[atozsass.com/g](http://www.atozsass.com/g) to copy and paste!):

{% highlight js %}
module.exports = function( grunt ) {
	grunt.initConfig({
		sass: {
			dist: {
				files: {
					'css/main.css' : 'scss/main.scss'
				}
			}
		},
		watch: {
			css: {
				files: '**/*.scss',
				tasks: ['sass']
			}
		}
	});
	grunt.loadNpmTasks( 'grunt-contrib-sass' );
	grunt.loadNpmTasks( 'grunt-contrib-watch' );
	grunt.registerTask( 'default', ['watch'] );
}
{% endhighlight %}

This sets up two Grunt tasks, one called `watch` that watches our Sass
files for changes and one called `sass` that compiles `main.scss` into
`main.css`. If you use this setup in future projects, you may have to make
adjustments to the file paths but this is a great starting point.

Grunt can now be run with the `grunt` command, optionally specifying the
name of the task afterwards.

Running `grunt sass` will run the `sass` command and your styles will be
compiled once.

Running `grunt watch` will run the `watch` task and Grunt will run and
keep watching for changes until you quit by using the keyboard shortcut
`Ctrl+C`.

Running `grunt` without a task name will run the `default` task which in
this case just runs `watch` but could be configured to do all sorts of
other things too.

To double check everything works as expected, write some Sass code in
your `main.scss` file, hit save, check your terminal to see that Grunt
detected a change and then look inside the `css` folder. You should see
your compiled CSS in a file called `main.css`. Nice work!



## Compiling Sass with Gulp

Gulp is a very similar tool to Grunt but uses a different style of
configuration and a different approach to running the tasks behind the
scenes. 

The Gulp config syntax may look more familiar if you're used to
writing JS or jQuery code and while I've used both Grunt and Gulp, I now
favour Gulp for all my projects.

For this exercise, I've got another bare-bones project with an `scss`
folder with a `main.scss` file for my Sass and a `css` folder for the
styles to be compiled into.

The initial Gulp setup follows a similar process to Grunt.

First we need to install the Gulp tool globally so it can be used on any
project - this is a one-time installation so if you already have Gulp
installed, you can skip this step.

To install Gulp, run the following command.

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -g gulp
{% endhighlight %}

We now need to create a `package.json` which will list all the packages
needed for the Gulp tasks.

{% highlight bash %}
npm init
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need to install a local version of Gulp and the Gulp Sass
package:

{% highlight bash %}
npm install --save-dev gulp gulp-sass
{% endhighlight %}

With the packages installed, we create a configuration file to set up
our tasks. Create a `gulpfile.js` in the project root with the following
code (just head to
[atozsass.com/g](http://www.atozsass.com/g) to copy and paste!):

{% highlight js %}
var gulp = require( 'gulp' );
var sass = require( 'gulp-sass' );

gulp.task( 'sass', function() {
	gulp.src( 'scss/main.scss' )
		.pipe( sass().on( 'error', sass.logError ) )
		.pipe( gulp.dest( './css/' ) );
});

gulp.task( 'default', function() {
	gulp.watch( 'scss/**/*.scss', ['sass'] );
});
{% endhighlight %}

Now to run the tasks, we use the `gulp` command followed by the task
name. To compile your styles once, run `gulp sass`. To watch for changes
we can run the default task by just running `gulp` in the terminal from
the project root.

If all is working properly, you should see a `main.css` file compiled
when you add some Sass to `main.scss` and hit save.

So what's the difference between Grunt and Gulp and why are there two
very similar ways of doing the same thing?

The Gulp syntax is shorter and I personally find chained functions
easier to read than a big configuration object used with Grunt.

But the biggest difference lies in the compiler that's used behind the
scenes. Grunt uses Ruby Sass whereas Gulp uses Node Sass. Node Sass is
a wrapper for Libsass which is a much faster than the traditional Ruby
Sass.

On a big project compiling with Gulp will be significantly faster than
compiling with Grunt and that alone is the reason why I've switched from
Grunt to Gulp for all my projects.



## Next Steps with Automation

Having gone through the process of setting up these tools, we can now
add additional tasks to help speed up our workflow.

Two tools that I couldn't live without are Live Reload and Autoprefixer.

Live Reload will automatically refresh the browser when changes to any
files is detected. Even though this isn't a particularly difficult thing
to do manually, it's something that I do hundreds of times per day so
the time saving is hundreds of times multiplied by however long it takes
me to `cmd-tab` between my editor and browser and hit `cmd-r` to
refresh. It's a micro optimisation but totally worth it.

[Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) is a postCSS
plugin that runs on your compiled CSS and adds in any vendor prefixes
where needed as per the data on [caniuse.com](http://www.caniuse.com).
This means I never have to write prefixes in my Sass and means I can
just focus on making things, rather than faffing around looking up or
writing prefixes manually.

Whether you prefer Grunt or Gulp, I'd highly recommend automating your
development process where possible as it's one less thing you'll have to
think about.



## Outro

In the next episode we'll be discussing H for "Handy Mixins". I was
struggling to find a Sass concept starting with "H" but having a helping
hand with a handful of helpful mixins should be a good compromise
instead.
