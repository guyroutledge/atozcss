Warn Error Debug

When crafting complex functions, mixins or perhaps even your own 
framework or Sass plugin it can be useful to display messages on the
console to ensure your code is working correctly and being used
correctly. Sass has three different methods of interacting with the
console that we'll cover in this episode. They are:

* @warn
* @error
* @debug
