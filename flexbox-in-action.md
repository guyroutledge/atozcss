You've probably heard of flexbox - the Flexible Box Layout Module - it's
been getting a lot of attention recently because the browser support is
very strong now. 

It's the hot new thing in CSS layout and you want to level up and start 
putting flexbox to work in your projects.

But perhaps you've yet to have the chance to use it on a real project.
Maybe you're concerned about browser support or convincing your boss
that it's worth exploring.

You've read about the theory but it's hard to know when, where and
exactly how to put it into practice.

Flexbox is __now supported without any vendor prefixes in all modern
browsers__ so there's no time like the present to learn this powerful
new toolset.

## Learn the Theory and Put it into Practice

In this live, online training workshop you'll learn the flexbox
fundamentals *and* __put your new-found knowledge into practice__
through practical exercises and code alongs.

Flexbox takes a very different approach to layout and instead of using
terms like horizontal and vertical, left and right, or top and bottom it
has a main axis of flow, a cross axis of flow, flex-start and flex-end.
It's this very different appraoch to layout that makes it __very
flexible and very powerful__ but it also means there's plenty to learn
and understand before putting it to use.


## You'll Get Accountability and Feedback

I don't know about you, but I've read a lot of tutorials and watched
a lot of screencasts. It's easy to kick back and soak things up and
think "yeah, I see what's going on" but nothing beats actually writing
code. 

__Learning by doing is more engaging__ and will help you understand the
concepts better.

As part of this workshop you'll be set a practical homework exercise,
based on the material covered in the workshop. You'll have the
opportunity to practice in your own time and submit your work for review
and feedback. 

Guy and the AtoZ CSS teaching assistants will provide personalised
comments and suggestions to help you improve and further your knowledge.


## What will I learn?

In this workshop you'll learn:

* What flexbox is and how it's different from traditional layout methods
* The two axis of flexbox
